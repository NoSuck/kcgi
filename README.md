## Synopsis

kcgi is an open source CGI and FastCGI library for C web applications.
It is minimal, secure, and auditable; and fits within your
[BCHS](https://learnbchs.org) software stack.

This repository consists of bleeding-edge code between versions: to keep
up to date with the current stable release of kcgi, visit the [kcgi
website](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcgi).
The website also contains canonical installation, deployment, and usage
documentation.
This page describes using the bleeding-edge version of the system.

## Example

Implementing a CGI or FastCGI application with kcgi is easy (for values
of easy strictly greater than "knows C").
Specify the pages recognised by the application and the known HTML form
inputs.
kcgi parses the request and can manage output.

```c
#include <sys/types.h> /* size_t, ssize_t */
#include <stdarg.h> /* va_list */
#include <stddef.h> /* NULL */
#include <stdint.h> /* int64_t */
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <kcgi.h>
 
int main(void) {
  struct kreq r;
  const char *page = "index";
  if (KCGI_OK != khttp_parse(&r, NULL, 0, &page, 1, 0))
	return(EXIT_FAILURE);
  khttp_head(&r, kresps[KRESP_STATUS],
	"%s", khttps[KHTTP_200]);
  khttp_head(&r, kresps[KRESP_CONTENT_TYPE], 
	"%s", kmimetypes[r.mime]);
  khttp_body(&r);
  khttp_puts(&r, "Hello, world!\n");
  khttp_free(&r);
  return(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

## Installation

To use the bleeding-edge version of kcgi (instead of from your system's
packages or a stable version), the process it the similar as for source
releases.

Begin by cloning or downloading.  Then compile with `make` (GNU make, so
it may be `gmake` on your system), then `sudo make install` (or using
`doas`).  To install in an alternative directory to `/usr/local`, set
the `PREFIX` variable when installing.

```sh
make
doas make install PREFIX=/opt
```

You can also change the default value in the
[GNUmakefile](https://github.com/kristapsdz/kcgi/blob/master/GNUmakefile).

## API Reference

For the repository version of kcgi, the locally-installed manpages are
the canonical source of information.  (The web-site reflects the latest
release, which may be older than what you have.)

```sh
man kcgi
apropos kcgi
```

This assumes that kcgi has been installed in a path recognised by your
manpage reader.
On most systems, `/opt` (as in the above example) is not recognised, so
you may need to edit `/etc/man.conf` or other configuration file
appropriate to your system.

## Tests

It's useful to run the installed regression tests on the bleeding edge
sources.
(Again, this uses GNU make, so it may be `gmake` on your system.)

```sh
make regress
```

The system contains a full regression suite and is also built to work
with [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).
To run some of the bundled tests, use the binaries compiled into the
`afl` directory.
(Again, this uses GNU make, so it may be `gmake` on your system.)

```sh
make afl
cd afl
afl-fuzz -i in/urlencoded -o out -- ./afl-urlencoded
```
