			Implement the <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/node/6?q=node/22">FastCGI</a> control process's sandbox for all
			supported operating systems.
			(The FastCGI control process is forked from each application process, and is responsible for accepting new FastCGI
			connections and passing the descriptors to the application for output and worker process for parsing.)
			This is the last <q>feature</q> for the FastCGI implementation: it now has the same protection as the CGI implementation
			for all child processes.
