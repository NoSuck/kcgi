			Implement the <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/node/6?q=node/22">FastCGI</a> control process's sandbox for all
			supported operating systems.
			(The FastCGI control process is forked from each application process, and is responsible for accepting new FastCGI
			connections and passing the descriptors to the application for output and worker process for parsing.)
			This is the last <q>feature</q> for the FastCGI implementation: it now has the same protection as the CGI implementation
			for all child processes.

		<div>
			Add initial (full) sandbox for OpenBSD's <a
				href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man2/tame.2">tame(2)</a>, although this technically
			isn't supported yet (in snapshots, anyway) and returns ENOSYS.
			On OpenBSD machines with both sandboxes, this is tried first.
		</div>
		<div>
			This is the last release before the FastCGI implementation is marked as stable.
			In addition to the above, some variables were added to the manpages (which were also cleaned up a bit) and the AFL
			system was updated with the socket re-write.
