		Add ability to retrieve HTTP headers from the request.
		This adds several fields to the structure filled in by <a href="khttp_parse.3.html">khttp_parse(3)</a> that allow for mapped
		(indexed by known header) and listed header fields.
		The HTTP headers are reconstituted from the CGI environmental variables according to the RFC.
		These fields existed in earlier releases, but were not documented and, moreover, did not reconstitute the HTTP header name from
		the CGI environment variable name.
