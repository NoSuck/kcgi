			Add ability to retrieve HTTP headers from the request.
			This adds several fields to the structure filled in by <a href="khttp_parse.3.html">khttp_parse(3)</a> that allow for mapped
			(indexed by known header) and listed header fields.
			The HTTP headers are reconstituted from the CGI environmental variables according to the RFC.
			These fields existed in earlier releases, but were not documented and, moreover, did not reconstitute the HTTP header name from
			the CGI environment variable name.
			A regression test has been added to test this behaviour.
			While adding this documentation, clean up the type list in <a href="khttp_parse.3.html">khttp_parse(3)</a>.

		<div>
			Add <a href="khttp_body.3.html">khttp_body_compress(3)</a>, which allows for stipulating auto-compression (the default for
			<a href="khttp_body.3.html">khttp_body(3)</a>), compression without emitting the appropriate header (for applications
			providing the <q>Content-Encoding</q> parameter themselves), and no compression (for applications taking full control of
			output themselves).
			While there, make the test for requested compression be sensitive to the <a
				href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html">RFC 2616</a> <q>qvalue</q>.
			Both functions now return whether compression has been enabled.
			This functionality augments existing behaviour: it does not change it.
