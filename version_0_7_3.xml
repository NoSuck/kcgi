			Fix for proper FastCGI support on <a href="http://www.nginx.org">nginx</a>.
			This work was prompted by Daniel Sinclair, who fixed a read type mismatch (when reading the padding length) that inspired
			a further fix to serialise the response FastCGI header properly.
			Lastly, a latent Apache2 FastCGI bug was fixed in incorrectly reporting the return code status.
