.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm kcgi
library handles the CGI environment for C web applications.
Interfacing applications generally call
.Fn khttp_parse
as early as possible, with
.Fn khttp_free
before the system exits.
Upon processing the
.Vt "struct kpair"
field element input, output is emitted first using
.Fn khead
for HTTP headers, then
.Fn kbody
to indicate the start of content.
Finally, the
.Fn kattr ,
.Fn kelem ,
and so on functions are used to output HTML trees.
.Pp
The library is built around parsers for HTTP form data (cookies, GET,
and POST) with support for multipart forms.
The multipart parsing is still somewhat experimental in terms of
features, though all parsing is rigorously checked for security (e.g.,
integer overflow, binary data, etc.).
.Ss Variables
The application must define the
.Vt pages
and
.Vt keys
structures provided to
.Fn khttp_parse .
The former is a string array of page names (without the suffix).
The latter array of
.Vt "struct kvalid"
consists of the following entries:
.Bl -ohang
.It Va "int (*valid)(struct kpair *)"
Validating function.
This can be
.Dv NULL
if anything goes.
.It Va "const char *name"
The field name, i.e., how it appears in the HTML form input name.
This cannot be
.Dv NULL .
.\" .It Va "enum kfield field"
.\" How to format the field value upon repopulation.
.\" This can be
.\" .Dv KFIELD__MAX
.\" if the value shouldn't be repopulated.
.\" .It Va "const char *label"
.\" Populate an HTML label element.
.\" Can be
.\" .Dv NULL
.\" if it doesn't have a label.
.\" .It Va "const char *def"
.\" Default value for population fields.
.El
.Ss Types
The
.Vt "struct kreq"
type is central to
.Nm kcgi .
It consists of the following fields:
.Bl -ohang
.It Va method
The
.Dv METHOD_GET
or
.Dv METHOD_POST submission method.
Note that other methods aren't supported.
.It Va cookies
All key-value pairs read from user cookies.
.It Va cookiesz
The size of the
.Va cookies
array.
.It Va cookiemap
Entries in
.Va cookies
mapped into field indices as defined by the
.Fa keys
argument to
.Fn khttp_parse .
.It Va fields
All key-value pairs read from the POST and GET requests.
.It Va fieldsz
The number of elements in the
.Va fields
array.
.It Va fieldmap
Entries in
.Fa fields
mapped into field indices as defined by the
.Fa keys
arguments to
.Fn khttp_parse .
.It Va mime
The MIME type of the requested file as determined by its suffix.
This defaults to
.Dv MIME_HTML
if no suffix is specified.
.It Va page
The page index as defined by the
.Va pages
array passed to
.Fn khttp_parse
and parsed from the requested file.
This is the
.Em first
path component!
The default page provided to
.Fn khttp_parse
is used if no path was specified or
.Dv PATH__MAX
if the path failed lookup.
.It Va path
The path (or
.Dv NULL )
following the parsed component regardless of whether it was located in
the path array provided to
.Fn khttp_parse .
.It Va elems
Used by the HTML functions for the HTML tree.
Should not be touched.
.It Va elemsz
The position in the
.Va elems
stack.
Should not be touched.
.El
.Pp
Another central type is
.Vt "struct kpair" ,
which presents the user with fields parsed from input and (possibly)
matched to the
.Fa keys
variable passed to
.Fn http_parse .
.Bl -ohang
.It Fa key
The nil-terminated key name.
.It Fa val
The value, which is always nil-terminated, but if the data is binary,
nil terminators may occur before the true data length of
.Fa valsz .
.It Fa valsz
The true length of
.Fa val ,
which is the same as
.Xr strlen 3
if the data is not binary.
.It Fa def
The default value of the field.
Used in repopulating the data.
.El
.Ss Functions
The following functions initialise an HTTP request.
.Bl -ohang
.It Fn khttp_free "struct kreq *req"
Free the memory of a context created by
.Fn khttp_parse .
.It Fn khttp_parse "struct kreq *req" \
"const struct kvalid *keys" \
"size_t keymax" \
"const char *const *pages" \
"size_t pagemax"
Fill a request
.Fa req
with input fields from the CGI environment.
Array
.Fa keys
of size
.Fa keymax
consists of input and validation fields, while
.Fa pages
of size
.Fa pagemax
is for page mapping.
.El
.Pp
The following functions create an HTML tree.
.Bl -ohang
.It Fn kattr "struct kreq *req" "enum kelem elem" "..."
Open the scope of element
.Fa kelem
with matching key-value pairs in the varargs for its attributes.
The maximum number of nested scopes is fixed at 128.
The terminating attribute key must be
.Dv ATTR__MAX.
.It Fn kbody "struct kreq *req"
End a sequence of HTTP headers outputted with
.Fn khead .
The
.Fn khead
function must not be called after this.
.It Fn kclosure "struct kreq *req" "size_t count"
Close the last
.Fa count
scopes.
This will call
.Xr abort 3
if
.Fa count
exceeds the number of open scopes.
.It Fn kdecl "struct kreq *req"
Emit the document HTML declaration.
.It Fn kelem "struct kreq *req" "enum kelem elem"
Invokes
.Fn kattr
with no attributes.
.\" .It Fn input "struct kreq *req" "enum key key"
.\" Emit the HTML code for the input element
.\" .Fa key
.\" and its label as defined in the user-defined array
.\" .Va keys .
.\" This will also fill in a value as stored in the input fields of
.\" .Va req .
.\" This is meant to simplify the repopulation of fields.
.It Fn khead "struct kreq *req" "const char *key" "const char *val"
Emit an HTTP header
.Fa key
with value
.Fa val .
This occurs before any HTML functions are invoked, and must be followed
by
.Fn kbody
to indicate the start of document content.
.It Fn ksym "struct kreq *req" "enum kentity entity"
Emit the HTML code for
.Va entity .
.It Fn ktext "struct kreq *req" "const char *cp"
Emit the text
.Va cp ,
escaping it for HTML if necessary.
.El
.Pp
The following functions are provided for the global
.Va keys
array.
.Bl -ohang
.It Fn kvalid_double "struct kpair *kp"
Validate a double-precision floating-point number.
.It Fn kvalid_email "struct kpair *kp"
Validate an e-mail address.
.Em Note :
this is a heuristic validation, not a formal one.
.It Fn kvalid_int "struct kpair *kp"
Validate a signed 64-bit integer.
.It Fn kvalid_string "struct kpair *kp"
Validate a nil-terminated string.
This is also used by the
.Fn kvalid_double ,
.Fn kvalid_email ,
.Fn kvalid_int ,
.Fn kvalid_udouble ,
and
.Fn kvalid_uint
to make sure the string representation of their data is sane.
.It Fn kvalid_udouble "struct kpair *kp"
Validate a positive non-zero double-precision floating-point number.
.It Fn kvalid_uint "struct kpair *kp"
Validate an unsigned 64-bit natural number.
.El
.Pp
The following functions provide safe wrappers for memory allocation.
They simply call through to the standard
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr calloc 3
and so on:
.Nm
does
.Em not
manage its own memory!
.Bl -ohang
.It Fn kcalloc "size_t nm" "size_t sz"
Allocate and zero or exit on memory exhaustion.
.It Fn kmalloc "size_t sz"
Allocate or exit on memory exhaustion.
.It Fn krealloc "void *p" "size_t nm" "size_t sz"
Allocate or exit on memory allocation and discourage multiplication
overflows when multipying count by type size.
.It Fn kstrdup "const char *cp"
Allocate or exit on memory exhaustion.
.It Fn kxrealloc "void *p" "size_t sz"
Allocate or exit on memory exhaustion.
.El
