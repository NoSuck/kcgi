.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm kcgi
library handles the CGI environment for C web applications.
Interfacing applications generally work as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
Call
.Fn khttp_parse
as early as possible.
This will parse input fields and set up the HTTP environment.
.It
Process input fields by examining the
.Vt "struct kpair"
elements.
.It
Emit HTTP headers with
.Fn khttp_head ,
followed by
.Fn khttp_body
to begin the HTTP body.
.It
Emit HTTP body output using HTML-building functions
.Fn khtml_attr ,
.Fn khtml_close ,
.Fn khtml_closeto ,
.Fn khtml_decl ,
.Fn khtml_elem ,
.Fn khtml_elemat ,
.Fn khtml_entity ,
.Fn khtml_input ,
.Fn khtml_ncr
and
.Fn khtml_text ;
or
.It
use the
.Fn khtml_template
system with a mixture of HTML-building functions; or
.It
use
.Fn khttp_putc
and
.Fn khttp_puts
for non-HTML media.
.Em \&Do not
use
.Xr printf 3
or other functions to append to standard output:
.Nm kcgi
will automatically compress output if requested by the client, and
overriding the output stream will circumvent this behaviour and might
mix compressed and uncompressed data.
.It
Call
.Fn khttp_free
to clean up.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
library is built around the
.Fn khttp_parse
parsers for HTTP form data (cookies, GET, and POST) with support for
multipart forms.
The multipart parsing is still somewhat experimental in terms of
features, though all parsing is rigorously checked for security (e.g.,
integer overflow, binary data, etc.).
.Pp
To compile applications with
.Nm ,
make sure
.Pa kcgi.h
is in the header path and
.Pa libkcgi.a
in the library path, then link with
.Fl Ar lkcgi
and
.Fl Ar lz
.Pq unless compression has been disabled at compile-time .
.Ss Types
The
.Vt "struct kreq"
type is central to
.Nm kcgi .
It consists of the following fields:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Va method
The
.Dv KMETHOD_GET
or
.Dv KMETHOD_POST
submission method.
Note that other methods aren't supported.
.It Va auth
Type of HTTP authorisation, if any.
If an authorisation is specified but with unknown type (i.e., not digest
or basic authentiation), this is set to
.Dv KAUTH_UNKNOWN .
.It Va cookies
All key-value pairs read from user cookies.
.It Va cookiesz
The size of the
.Va cookies
array.
.It Va cookiemap
Entries in successfully-parsed (or un-parsed)
.Va cookies
mapped into field indices as defined by the
.Fa keys
argument to
.Fn khttp_parse .
.It Va cookienmap
Entries in unsuccessfully-parsed (but still attempted)
.Fa cookies
mapped into field indices as defined by the
.Fa keys
argument to
.Fn khttp_parse .
.It Va fields
All key-value pairs read from the POST and GET requests.
.It Va fieldsz
The number of elements in the
.Va fields
array.
.It Va fieldmap
Entries in successfully-parsed (or un-parsed)
.Fa fields
mapped into field indices as defined by the
.Fa keys
arguments to
.Fn khttp_parse .
.It Va fieldnmap
Entries in unsuccessfully-parsed (but still attempted)
.Fa fields
mapped into field indices as defined by the
.Fa keys
argument to
.Fn khttp_parse .
.It Va mime
The MIME type of the requested file as determined by its suffix.
This defaults to
.Dv MIME_HTML
if no suffix is specified.
.It Va page
The page index as defined by the
.Va pages
array passed to
.Fn khttp_parse
and parsed from the requested file.
This is the
.Em first
path component!
The default page provided to
.Fn khttp_parse
is used if no path was specified or
.Dv PATH__MAX
if the path failed lookup.
.It Va path
The path (or
.Dv NULL )
following the parsed component regardless of whether it was located in
the path array provided to
.Fn khttp_parse .
For example, if the
.Dv PATH_INFO
is
.Pa foo.cgi/bar/baz ,
the path component would be
.Pa baz
.Pq with the leading slash stripped .
.It Va fullpath
The full path following the server name or
.Dv NULL
if there is no path following the server.
For example, if
.Pa foo.cgi/bar/baz
is the
.Dv PATH_INFO ,
this would be
.Pa /bar/baz .
.It Va kdata
Internal data.
Should not be touched.
.It Va keys
Value passed to
.Fn khttp_parse .
.It Va keysz
Value passed to
.Fn khttp_parse .
.It Va pages
Value passed to
.Fn khttp_parse .
.It Va pagesz
Value passed to
.Fn khttp_parse .
.El
.Pp
The application must define the
.Vt keys
provided to
.Fn khttp_parse
as an array of
.Vt "struct kvalid" ,
which consists of the following:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Va "int (*valid)(struct kpair *)"
Validating function.
This can be
.Dv NULL
if anything goes.
If you provide your own
.Fa valid
function, it must set the
.Fa field
and
.Fa parsed
variables in the key-value pair.
.It Va "const char *name"
The field name, i.e., how it appears in the HTML form input name.
This cannot be
.Dv NULL .
.It Va "enum kfield field"
How to format the field value if used in
.Fn khtml_input .
This can be
.Dv KFIELD__MAX
if the value shouldn't be repopulated.
.\" .It Va "const char *label"
.\" Populate an HTML label element.
.\" Can be
.\" .Dv NULL
.\" if it doesn't have a label.
.\" .It Va "const char *def"
.\" Default value for population fields.
.El
.Pp
The
.Vt "struct kpair"
structure presents the user with fields parsed from input and (possibly)
matched to the
.Fa keys
variable passed to
.Fn http_parse .
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Va key
The nil-terminated key (input) name.
.It Va val
The (input) value, which is always nil-terminated, but if the data is
binary, nil terminators may occur before the true data length of
.Fa valsz .
.It Va valsz
The true length of
.Fa val .
.It Va file
If the form provided a parsed file for the given key, this is the name
of the input file.
.It Va ctype
If the form provided a parsed file for the given key, this is the
content type (e.g.,
.Li image/jpeg )
of that file.
.It Va next
In a cookie or field map,
.Fa next
points to the next parsed key-value pair with the same
.Fa key
name.
.It Va field
If parsed, the type of data in
.Fa parsed ,
otherwise
.Dv KFIELD__MAX .
.It Va parsed
The parsed, validated value.
These may be integer, for a 64-bit signed integer; string, for a
nil-termianted character string; or double, for a double-precision
floating-point number.
.El
.Pp
The template system, driven by
.Fn khtml_template ,
uses
.Vt "struct ktemplate"
for its templating.
This consists of the following members:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Va key
An array of keys.
.It Va keysz
The number of elements in
.Va key .
.It Va arg
A pointer to pass to
.Va cb .
.It Va cb
A callback invoked when a key at position
.Fa key
is found in the
.Va key
array.
.El
.Ss Functions
The following functions initialise an HTTP request.
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Fn khttp_body "struct kreq *req"
End a sequence of HTTP headers outputted with
.Fn khttp_head .
The
.Fn khttp_head
function may not be called after this.
This function will append the
.Li Content-Encoding
HTTP parameter with compression support if the request specifies it.
If appended, all subsequent output will be compressed with
.Xr zlib 3 .
.It Fn khttp_free "struct kreq *req"
Free the memory of a context created by
.Fn khttp_parse
and, if applicable, closes the compressed output stream opened by
.Fn khttp_body .
.It Fn khttp_head "struct kreq *req" "const char *key" "const char *fmt" "..."
Emit an HTTP header
.Fa key
with value formatted by
.Fa fmt
and its variable arguments.
This occurs before any HTML functions are invoked.
The sequence of
.Fn khttp_head
calls, if any, must be followed by a mandatory
.Fn khttp_body
to indicate the start of document content.
You may not invoke
.Fn khttp_head
subsequent to
.Fn khttp_body .
.It Fn khttp_parse "struct kreq *req" \
"const struct kvalid *keys" \
"size_t keysz" \
"const char *const *pages" \
"size_t pagesz"
Fill a request
.Fa req
with input fields from the CGI environment.
Array
.Fa keys
of size
.Fa keysz
consists of input and validation fields, while
.Fa pages
of size
.Fa pagesz
is for page mapping.
.El
.Pp
The following functions create an HTML tree.
None of these functions may be called before
.Fn khttp_body .
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Fn khtml_attr "struct kreq *req" "enum kelem elem" "..."
Open the scope of element
.Fa elem
with matching key-value pairs in the varargs for its attributes.
The maximum number of nested scopes is fixed at 128.
The terminating attribute key must be
.Dv ATTR__MAX.
.It Fn khtml_close "struct kreq *req" "size_t count"
Close the last
.Fa count
scopes.
This will call
.Xr abort 3
if
.Fa count
exceeds the number of open scopes.
If
.Fa count
is zero, this will close all scopes.
.It Fn khtml_closeto "struct kreq *req" "size_t pos"
Close until a certain level
.Fa pos
in the HTML tree, which must be at or above the current level.
Usually used with
.Fn khtml_elemat .
.It Fn khtml_decl "struct kreq *req"
Emit the document HTML declaration.
.It Fn khtml_elem "struct kreq *req" "enum kelem elem"
Invokes
.Fn khtml_attr
with no attributes.
.It Fn khtml_elemat "struct kreq *req"
Save the current point in the HTML tree.
Useful for saving a
.Fn khtml_closeto
rollback point.
.It Fn khtml_entity "struct kreq *req" "enum kentity entity"
Emit the numeric character reference for
.Va entity .
.It Fn khtml_input "struct kreq *req" "size_t key"
Emit the HTML code for the input element named
.Fa key
as defined in
.Va keys
passed to
.Fn khttp_parse .
This will also fill in a value if stored in parsed
.Va fieldmap
in
.Va req .
This is meant to simplify the repopulation of fields.
.It Fn khtml_ncr "struct kreq *req" "uint16_t ncr"
Emit the numeric character reference
.Va ncr .
.It Fn khtml_text "struct kreq *req" "const char *cp"
Emit the text
.Va cp ,
escaping it (e.g.,
.Sq \&> )
for HTML if necessary.
.El
.Pp
If your application puts data directly into the HTTP body without HTML
escaping, use the following functions:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Fn khttp_putc "struct kreq *req" "int c"
Append a single character
.Fa c
to the output stream.
.It Fn khttp_puts "struct kreq *req" "const char *cp"
Append a nil-terminated string
.Fa cp
to the output stream.
.El
.Pp
The following functions are provided for the global
.Va keys
array.
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Fn kvalid_double "struct kpair *kp"
Validate a double-precision floating-point number.
.It Fn kvalid_email "struct kpair *kp"
Validate an e-mail address.
.Em Note :
this is a heuristic validation, not a formal one.
.It Fn kvalid_int "struct kpair *kp"
Validate a signed 64-bit integer.
.It Fn kvalid_string "struct kpair *kp"
Validate a nil-terminated string.
This is also used by the
.Fn kvalid_double ,
.Fn kvalid_email ,
.Fn kvalid_int ,
.Fn kvalid_udouble ,
and
.Fn kvalid_uint
to make sure the string representation of their data is sane.
.It Fn kvalid_udouble "struct kpair *kp"
Validate a positive non-zero double-precision floating-point number.
.It Fn kvalid_uint "struct kpair *kp"
Validate an unsigned 64-bit natural number.
.El
.Pp
The following functions provide safe wrappers for memory allocation.
They simply call through to the standard
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr calloc 3
and so on:
.Nm
does
.Em not
manage its own memory!
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Fn kcalloc "size_t nm" "size_t sz"
Allocate and zero or exit on memory exhaustion.
.It Fn kmalloc "size_t sz"
Allocate or exit on memory exhaustion.
.It Fn krealloc "void *p" "size_t nm" "size_t sz"
Allocate or exit on memory allocation and discourage multiplication
overflows when multipying count by type size.
.It Fn kstrdup "const char *cp"
Allocate or exit on memory exhaustion.
.It Fn kxrealloc "void *p" "size_t sz"
Allocate or exit on memory exhaustion.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
library also has a simple, light-weight template system.
This is coordinated entirely by a single function,
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It Fn khtml_template "struct kreq *req" "struct ktemplate *t" "const char *fname"
This function memory-maps the file
.Fa fname
and appends it to the output stream.
Whenever a key is located, where keys are delimited as
.Li @@KEY@@
in
.Fa fname ,
it is looked up in the
.Fa t
key array.
If found, the callback is invoked with the key index and the optional
argument.
Callbacks may continue to process, emit HTML trees, and so on.
.El

A simple example exists in
.Pa @DATADIR@/sample.c .
It illustrates templating, form handling, and so on.
