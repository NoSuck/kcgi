			Push read-only repository to <a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/kcgi.git">GitHub</a>.
			<span class="nm">kcgi</span> has been accepted as a <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/kcgi">Coverity</a>
			project.
			The initial scan revealed a pair of error-path resource links and some false positives.
			(All of these are visible on the Coverity project site.)
			It also found one legitimate bug in the newly-installed HTTP basic authentication code.
			This, obviously, has been fixed.
			Thanks, <a href="http://coverity.com">Coverity</a>!
