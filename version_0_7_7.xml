			Allow for the developer to set a write buffer size when invoking <a href="khttp_parse.3.html">khttp_parsex(3)</a> or <a
				href="khttp_fcgi_init.3.html">khttp_fcgi_initx(3)</a>.
			The write buffer hooks into <a href="khttp_write.3.html">khttp_write(3)</a> and, if set to a non-zero size, will cause
			writes to be buffered.
			This changes existing behaviour where writes were never buffered.
			Note that this function is invoked by all writing functions, both within <a href="kcgi.3.html">kcgi(3)</a> and its
			libraries such as <a href="kcgijson.3.html">kcgijson(3)</a>.
			The buffer is flushed when its size is exceeded or when <a href="khttp_free.3.html">khttp_free(3)</a> is invoked.
			If not provided, the default is 8 KiB for CGI and 65 KiB for FastCGI.
			Also renamed the <code>xmalloc</code>-style internal functions so as not to override weak symbols in any interfacing
			applications.
			This was noted by Okan Demirmen&#8212;thanks!
