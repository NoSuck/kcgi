			Allow for the developer to set a write buffer size.
			The write buffer hooks into <a href="khttp_write.3.html">khttp_write(3)</a> and, if set to a non-zero size, will cause
			writes to be buffered.
			This changes existing behaviour where writes were never buffered.
			Note that this function is invoked by all writing functions, both within 
			<a href="kcgi.3.html">kcgi(3)</a> and its libraries such as <a href="kcgijson.3.html">kcgijson(3)</a>.
			The buffer is flushed when its size is exceeded or when <a href="khttp_free.3.html">khttp_free(3)</a> is invoked.
			The write buffer is built into both the FastCGI and CGI functionality.
			The buffer size is set in <a href="khttp_parse.3.html">khttp_parsex(3)</a> through a structure that will later hold
			other tunables.
			If not provided, the default is 8 KiB for CGI and 65 KiB for FastCGI.
