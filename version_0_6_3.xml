			More FastCGI: move control socket handling into its own process.
			The control socket is a UNIX socket (or similar) bound by the FastCGI runner, which is either the web server or an
			application like <a href="kfcgi.8.html">kfcgi(8)</a>, then passed as <code>STDIN_FILENO</code> to the FastCGI
			application.
			<span class="nm">kcgi</span> will then wait on this socket for incoming connections, which are acted upon with <a
				href="khttp_fcgi_parse.3.html">khttp_fcgi_parse(3)</a>.
			In this release, this logic has been moved into its own process instead of being managed by the web application itself
			during calls to <a href="khttp_fcgi_parse.3.html">khttp_fcgi_parse(3)</a>.
			While here, I cleaned up and simplified a lot of the sandbox and inter-process socket logic.
			The control socket is not yet sandboxed: that will come with later releases.
			Again, the FastCGI implementation is <strong>experimental</strong>!

			Patches for deployment on FreeBSD contributed by Baptiste Daroussin&#8212;thanks!
			In analysis, found that the <code>argfree</code> function to <a href="khttp_parse.3.html">khttp_parse(3)</a> wasn't
			being invoked if the <code>arg</code> was itself NULL.
			(This is clearly bad behaviour&#8212;not all functions need that argument!)
			This has been fixed as well.
