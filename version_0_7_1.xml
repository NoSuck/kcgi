			Fix: forgot to install <a href="kfcgi.8.html">kfcgi(8)</a>.
			Add flag to <a href="kfcgi.8.html">kfcgi(8)</a> to specify the connection backlog.
			Add <a href="khttp_fcgi_test.3.html">khttp_fcgi_test(3)</a> to see if an application should use the FastCGI or regular
			CGI functions.
			A regression noted by James Turner (thanks!): re-add the CGI sample, <span class="file">sample.c</span>, into the
			distributed source.
			There is also a FastCGI sample, <span class="file">sample-fcgi.c</span>.
			There is also a non-<span class="nm">kcgi</span> sample, <span class="file">sample-cgi.c</span>, used in creating the
			performance graphs.
