			Added ability to easily perform HTTP digest authentication, which is heavily used in <a
				href="http://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcaldav">kcaldav</a> and a few other systems.
			This manages all of the aspects of the sequences, from the child process performing an MD5 hash on the full data stream
			to the end check against a hash.

		<div>
			Add an experimental feature for debugging input and output streams.
			One can set debugging fields with <a href="khttp_parse.3.html">khttp_parsex(3)</a> or <a
				href="khttp_fcgi_init.3.html">khttp_fcgi_initx(3)</a> and have request reads or response writes logged to
			standard output.
			<strong>Note</strong>: this changes the system API, so make sure any systems calling the above functions are upgraded to
			account for the extra argument!
			Also merged a thorough documentation patch by Svyatoslav Mishyn&#8212;thanks!
