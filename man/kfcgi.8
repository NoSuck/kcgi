.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kfcgi
.Op Fl l Ar backlog
.Op Fl n Ar workers
.Op Fl p Ar chroot
.Op Fl s Ar sockpath
.Op Fl u Ar sockuser
.Op Fl U Ar procuser
.Ar prog Op arg0...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
server starts up
.Ar workers
processes of
.Ar prog
to handle FastCGI connections.
By default, it opens the socket
.Pa /var/www/run/httpd.sock
in mode 0660 under the current user and group, changes to a file-system
jail in
.Pa /var/www ,
then starts 3 workers executing
.Ar prog ,
which must exist relative to the file-system jail root.
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l Ar backlog
The connection backlog.
If unspecified or zero, this is set to the value of
.Fl n .
If too small, the web-server will not be able to pass in new connections.
.It Fl n Ar workers
The number of workers >1.
.It Fl p Ar chroot
Location of file-system jail.
This is mandatory: use the root directory if you insist on being
insecure.
.It Fl s Ar sockpath
Alternative socket path.
.It Fl u Ar sockuser
The user in whose name (user and group) the socket is created.
.It Fl U Ar procuser
The user in whose name the process is dropped.

.\" .Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.\" Not used in OpenBSD.
.\" .Sh RETURN VALUES

.Ex -std
.\" For sections 1, 6, and 8 only.
.Sh EXAMPLES
On OpenBSD, the default user for the web server is
.Dq www .
Assuming we have a server that doesn't need any files, we can run the
following to keep it in a safe jail:
.Pp
.D1 # kfcgi -u www -U www -- /fcgi-bin/prog
.Pp
This will execute
.Pa /fcgi-bin/prog
within the default file-system jail of
.Pa /var/www
as user
.Dq www .
It will create the default socket
.Pa /var/www/run/httpd.sock
in mode 0660 as user
.Dq www .
