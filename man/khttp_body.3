.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm khttp_body ,
.Nm khttp_body_compress
.Nd close the HTTP header sequence for kcgi
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkcgi
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdarg.h
.In stdint.h
.In unistd.h
.In kcgi.h
.Ft int
.Fo khttp_body
.Fa "struct kreq *req"

.Ft int
.Fo khttp_body_compress
.Fa "struct kreq *req"
.Fa "int compress"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm khttp_body
and
.Nm khttp_body_compress
functions terminate the zero or more
.Xr khttp_head 3
calls for a
.Xr kcgi 3
context.
After these functions, invoking
.Xr khttp_head 3
will result in undefined behaviour.
.Pp
.Nm khttp_body_compress
takes an additional argument,
.Fa compress ,
that dictates whether compression should be enabled.
If
.Nm khttp_body
is used, this argument is set as 1.
The values for
.Fa compress
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It >0
Check whether the
.Dq Accept-Encoding
request header specified
.Dq gzip
with a non-zero or empty q-value.
If so, emit the appropriate
.Dq Content-Encoding
header and try to enable write compression.
This auto-compression setting is the default behaviour of
.Nm khttp_body .
.It 0
Do not check for the request header and do not emit
.Dq Content-Encoding ,
but try to enable write compression anyway.
This is useful for applications overriding the
.Dq Content-Encoding
header themselves and want to explicitly stipulate output compression.
.It <0
Simply open the document body: do not fiddle with compression at all.
This is useful if the application will have complete control over the
output stream.
Calls to
.Xr khttp_write 3
will be uncompressed.
.El
.Pp
If
.Xr kcgi 3
is not built with
.Xr zlib 3
support, compression is never enabled regardless the argument to
.Fn khttp_body_compress .
If
.Xr zlib 3
fails when enabling compression, the error is reported and compression
is disabled.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Both functions will return zero if compression was not enabled and
non-zero if it was.
Enabling means only that subsequent calls to
.Xr khttp_write 3
and family will be compressed, not whether the compression
.Dq Content-Encoding
header was emitted.
