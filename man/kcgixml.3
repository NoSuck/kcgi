.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm kcgixml
functions extend
.Xr kcgi 3
output with very simpe XML-specific output.
None of these functions may be called before
.Xr khttp_body 3 .
.Pp
All
.Nm kcgixml
sequences begin and end with
.Nm kxml_open
and
.Nm kxml_close ,
respectively.
An array of possible elements is passed as
.Fa elems
to
.Fn kxml_open .
This is later indexed into with
.Fn kxml_push ,
.Fn kxml_pushnull ,
.Fn kxml_pushattrs ,
and
.Fn kxml_pushnullattrs
to open elements.
The
.Fn kxml_pop
family closes out opened elements.
.Pp
To use these functions, you must include the
.In kcgixml.h
header and compile with
.Lb kcgixml ,
for example,
.Bd -literal
% cc -I/usr/local/include -c -o sample.o sample.c
% cc -L/usr/local/lib -o sample -lkcgixml -lkcgi -lz
.Ed
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fn kxml_close
Close an XML context as opened with
.Fn kxml_open .
This will also close any open elements.
You should not use the object after invoking this function.
.It Fn kxml_open
Open an XML context, binding it to
.Fa elems ,
a set of elements (e.g.,
.Qq DAV:set
or
.Qq html ) ,
the number of elements
.Fa elemsz ,
the
.Xr kcgi 3
request object
.Fa req ,
and an output object
.Fa xml .
.It Fn kxml_push
Push the element-open tag indexed by
.Fn elem
onto the output stream.
.It Fn kxml_pushattrs
Push the element-open tag indexed by
.Fn elem
onto the output stream, as well as a sequence of nil-terminated pairs of
attributes.
The last attribute key must be a
.Dv NULL
to terminate the list.
.It Fn kxml_pushnull
Like
.Fn kxml_push ,
but producing an empty-element tag.
.It Fn kxml_pushnullattrs
Like
.Fn kxml_pushattrs ,
but producing an empty-element tag.
.It Fn kxml_pop
Pop the current open tag as opened by
.Fn kxml_push
or
.Fn kxml_pushattrs .
.It Fn kxml_popall
Pop all open tags.
.It Fn kxml_putc
Write a single character within the currently-open tag, escaping it
properly as opaque text.
.It Fn kxml_puts
Invokes
.Fn kxml_putc
for all characters in the nil-terminated string.
.It Fn kxml_write
Invokes
.Fn kxml_putc
for all elements in the bounded buffer.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Functions returning an
.Vt int
indicating zero on failure and non-zero on success.
This occurs if the requested element is over
.Pq for Fn kxml_push
or under
.Pq for Fn kxml_pop
the scope domain.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm kcgixml
functions conform to the XML 1.0 mark-up specification.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
library was written by
.An Kristaps Dzonsons Aq Mt kristaps@bsd.lv .
