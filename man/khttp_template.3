.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm khttp_template
and
.Nm khttp_template_buf
are template functions for a
.Xr kcgi 3
context allocated with
.Xr khttp_parse 3 .
It may only come after
.Xr khttp_body 3
is invoked, else its behaviour is undefined.
.Pp
The
.Nm khttp_template
function memory-maps the regular file
.Fa fname
and passes the string into
.Nm khttp_template_buf .
.Pp
The
.Nm khttp_template_buf
function emits the buffer with
.Xr khttp_write 3
and friends until it reaches a
.Li @@foo@@
sequence (two
.Qq at
signs followed by a key, followed by a trailing pair of
.Qq at
signs).
The key is then looked up in the
.Fa t
argument's
.Va key
array of size
.Va keysz .
If found, the callback
.Va cb
is invoked with the key index and the optional
argument
.Va arg .
Callbacks may continue to process, emit HTML trees, and so on.
If it returns 0,
.Nm khttp_template_buf
fails.
If the key is not found, it is emitted as opaque text via
.Xr khttp_write 3
and friends.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm khttp_template
returns 0 if the
.Xr fstat 2 ,
.Xr open 2 ,
or
.Xr mmap 2
functions fail on the file, or the file is too large to map.
.Pp
Both
.Nm khttp_template
and
.Nm khttp_template_buf
fail if the callback function returns 0.
