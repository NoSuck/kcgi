.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm kcgi_regress_cgi
and
.Nm kcgi_regress_fcgi
functions are used for automated testing of
.Xr kcgi 3
systems, both as CGI and FastCGI scripts.
It is the mechanism used for internal regression tests as well.
.Pp
Applications wishing to use this framework provide callback functions to
.Fn kcgi_regress_cgi
and
.Fn kcgi_regress_fcgi ,
which invoke
.Fa server
with argument
.Fa serverArg
within a CGI or FastCGI environment as if it were spawned by a web
server, upon which the usual
.Xr khttp_parse 3
or
.Xr khttp_fcgi_init 3
and
.Xr khttp_fcgi_parse 3
functions are used to test behaviour.
Meanwhile, the
.Fa client
function is invoked for communicating with the server over port 17123.
The
.Xr libcurl 3
library is used for internal testing on the client side.
.Pp
In most applications, the main function invokes
.Nm kcgi_regress_cgi
or
.Nm kcgi_regress_fcgi ,
prepares a libCURL request in the client callback, then runs the usual
.Xr kcgi 3
sequence in the server callback.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Both the
.Fa client
and
.Fa server
functions should return zero on test failure.
.Fn kcgi_regress_cgi
and
.Fn kcgi_regress_fcgi
return zero if any tests or internal machinery fail.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm kcgihtml
library was written by
.An Kristaps Dzonsons Aq Mt kristaps@bsd.lv .
