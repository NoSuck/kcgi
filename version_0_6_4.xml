			Add some proper security to <a href="kfcgi.8.html">kfcgi(8)</a>: place child FastCGI processes in a file-system jail,
			drop privileges, and ensure proper ownership of the socket.
			While here, begin sandbox mechanisms for the FastCGI control process.
			This only works for Mac OSX for now, but will expand to others.

			Incorporate a patch from Baptiste Daroussin (thanks!) for a tighter Capsicum sandbox for the parser process.
